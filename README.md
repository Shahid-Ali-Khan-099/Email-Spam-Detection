# Spam-Email-Detection
Developed a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam based on their content and metadata.

Employed techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) and feature engineering to extract relevant features from email texts.

Utilized classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, logistic regression, or support vector machines (SVM) to train the model.

Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring itseffectiveness in accurately identifying spam emails while minimizing false positives.
